# ARPRO

This public repository is intended to have all the code we create during the lab.

In order to download the code you can run the this command where you this repository.

      git clone https://github.com/aGotelli/ARPRO.git

This folder is divided into two branches: s1_s2 and s3, accordingly to you schedule in OnBoard where group one and two are always together and group three is alone.

In order to see the code in the correct branch, open a terminal in the ARPRO repository and run the command

    git checkout "your branch"

Where you will replace "your branch" with s1_s2 or s3.


## What you can do

Use this code to check if you missed something during the lab.

Open an issue if something is not clear to you or you would like to discuss a solution.

If you don't know how to open an issue: https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue

You could also try to finish the exercise we started during the lab and then we discuss the implementation in class, leaving the author anonymous.

This can be achieved committing the code (which is different from opening an issue).

If you don't know hot to commit some code:
https://github.com/git-guides/git-commit

Note that all the above can be simply handled with a proper GUI such as: https://www.gitkraken.com/

## What you ABSOLUTELY cannot do

Do not take this as a replacement for the lab. If I notice that students are missing, I will simply delete the repository.

Setting the git environment is easy but I cannot take the time to explain it to you during the labs, as I already have many topics to cover. If you have problem using this repository ask your colleagues or leave it.

The usage of this repository is not mandatory. The goal of the labs is to introduce you to C++ and not git. Paying attention during the lectures and doing exercises will be more than enough.
